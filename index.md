###The Idea
Wrapping up [useR2015](http://user2015.math.aau.dk) in a few words: it was a fantastic conference. We met a 
lot of wonderful open minded people, who enlarged our water research driven universe. 

All R users are taking advantage of the nearly infinite problems that can be solved with it in a systematic, transparent and automatised way. Both, automatisation and transparency are a prerequisite for achieving the "gold standard": [reproducible research](http://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/duke-techexpo2015/#/4) 


###The Challenge

**Creating a centralized R knowledge hub for reproducible research** by wrapping the state of the art 
tools & packages available for R.


###What to do?

1. Screen the R world for already available tools which you are using because of their excellant functionality. 

2. Add them 

3. Explain from a functional point of view why your proposed tool is so great

4. Community should evaluate the usefulness!

####Which components? 

What are the best tools/packages for:

**1. Data**
- Import: getting different file formats, DBs & Web data into the R universe
- Preparation: cleaning, aggregating
- Analysis: graphical visualisation

**2. Modelling**

Examples:
- [Wrap your model](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.2140.3683)
  + Machine learning: [mlr package](http://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/tutorial/release/html/)
  + Environmental: e.g. [openmodelling](http://kwb-r.github.io/openmodelling/)

- do you have some more?

Usual workflow:
- Parameterise
- Run,
- Analyse,
- Calibrate,
- Validate,
- Predict and .....

**3. Document**

your results (automatically).

**4. Deployment**: 
-  Web-based or stand-alone?, 
-  Development or production?, 
-  in case of production: does your used tool scale without being too expensive (i.e. price is independent to
the number of connected users?)

**Tools:** 
[Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com),
[OpenCpu](http://opencpu.org) R API, ... 

**5. Additional topics**: 
- Crowdsourcing: e.g. [Ohmage](http://www.ohmage.org/)

- Learning:
  + OpenBooks: e.g. statistics: [OpenIntro](http://www.openintro.org); R: [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), R packages(http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)....
  + Training: [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com)
