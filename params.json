{"name":"A Central Knowledge Hub for Reproducible Research with R","tagline":"Reproducibility = Transparency (open data, models & software) + Automatisation","body":"###The Idea\r\nWrapping up [useR2015](http://user2015.math.aau.dk) in a few words: it was a fantastic conference. We met a \r\nlot of wonderful open minded people, who enlarged our water research driven universe. \r\n\r\nAll R users are taking advantage of the nearly infinite problems that can be solved with it in a systematic, \r\ntransparent and automatised way. Both, automatisation and transparency are a prerequisite for achieving the\r\n\"gold standard\": reproducible research. \r\n\r\n###The Challenge\r\n\r\n**Creating a centralized R knowledge hub for reproducible research** for wrapping the state of the art \r\ntools & packages for R enabling this challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n###What to do?\r\n\r\n1. Screen the R world for already available tools which you are using because of their excellant functionality. \r\n\r\n2. Add them \r\n\r\n3. Explain from a functional point of view why your proposed tool is so great\r\n\r\n4. Community should evaluate the usefulness!\r\n\r\n####Which components? \r\n\r\nWhat are the best tools/packages for:\r\n\r\n**1. Data**\r\n- Import: getting different file formats, DBs & Web data into the R universe\r\n- Preparation: cleaning, aggregating\r\n- Analysis: graphical visualisation\r\n\r\n**2. Modelling**\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- [Wrap your model](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.2140.3683)\r\n  + Machine learning: [mlr package](http://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/tutorial/release/html/)\r\n  + Environmental: e.g. [openmodelling](http://kwb-r.github.io/openmodelling/)\r\n\r\n- do you have some more?\r\n\r\nUsual workflow:\r\n- Parameterise\r\n- Run,\r\n- Analyse,\r\n- Calibrate,\r\n- Validate,\r\n- Predict and .....\r\n\r\n**3. Document**\r\n\r\nyour results (automatically).\r\n\r\n**4. Deployment**: \r\n-  Web-based or stand-alone, \r\n-  Development or production, \r\n-  in case of production: does the used tool scale without being too expensive?\r\n\r\n**5. Additional topics**: \r\n- Crowdsourcing: e.g. [Ohmage](http://ohmage.org/)\r\n\r\n- Learning:\r\n  + OpenBooks: e.g. statistics [OpenIntro](openintro.org), ....\r\n  + Training: [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com)\r\n  \r\nMissed some? Please help us!!!\r\n  \r\n###Who?\r\nEvery member of the R community is invited to contribute!\r\n\r\n###When?\r\nQuality of the recommendations should always be the major objective.\r\n","google":"UA-61646126-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
